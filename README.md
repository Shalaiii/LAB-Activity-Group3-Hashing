# INTRODUCE WHAT IS IT

This is a Java console application that uses a hash table data structure to manage the user's data. It demonstrates how to store, retrieve, and delete information efficiently using keys and values.

# WHAT IT CAN DO

This application can add user data (name and email), search for a user's email using their name, remove a user's data by their name, exits the program and provide an interactive menu for easy navigation.

# WHY MAKE THIS APPLICATION AND HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO ME AND TO THE COMMUNITY

This application is to provide a practical example of how hash tables can be used in real-world scenarios for data management. To me, it enhances my understanding of hash-based data structures and helps build problem-solving skills in Java programming. It also serves as a starting point for learners to explore hashing concepts to the community and understand how they can be applied in applications like user management systems, caching, or database indexing.
