#HashingNameEmail

This is a Java console application that uses a hash table data structure to manage the user's data. It demonstrates how to store, retrieve, and delete information efficiently using keys and values.

This application can add user data (name and email), search for a user's email using their name, remove a user's data by their name, exits the program and provide an interactive menu for easy navigation.

This application is to provide a practical example of how hash tables can be used in real-world scenarios for data management. To me, it enhances my understanding of hash-based data structures and helps build problem-solving skills in Java programming. It also serves as a starting point for learners to explore hashing concepts to the community and understand how they can be applied in applications like user management systems, caching, or database indexing.
